# Impact of School Enrollment on Economic Growth: A Python Data Science & AI Analysis
This repository contains the analysis and presentation conducted as part of a Python Data Science & AI class. The project investigates the impact of school enrollment on economic growth using statistical methods and data analysis in Python.

**Research Questions**

We explored the following research questions:
1. What is the relationship between primary school enrollment rates and GDP growth in developing countries?
2. What is the relationship between secondary school enrollment rates and GDP growth in developing countries?
3. Is there a relationship between school enrollment rates and GDP growth across countries at different stages of development?

**Hypotheses**

Based on the research questions, we formulated the following hypotheses:
1. Countries with higher primary school enrollment rates experience faster GDP growth than those with lower enrollment rates.
2. Countries with higher secondary school enrollment rates experience faster GDP growth than those with lower enrollment rates.
3. The impact of school enrollment rates on GDP growth differs across countries at different stages of development, with lower-income countries (e.g., Haiti) experiencing a stronger positive effect compared to middle-income (e.g., India) and high-income countries (e.g., the United States).

**Analysis and Conclusion**

Using t-test statistics, we analyzed the data to test these hypotheses. Our findings indicate that school enrollment rates alone do not significantly impact GDP growth. While education remains crucial for economic development, other factors (such as economic policies and infrastructure) appear to have a stronger influence on a country's economic growth.
